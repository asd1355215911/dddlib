Default event dispatcher to be public and overridable.
and to take method name as parameter?

Functionality:
Can change name of aggregate apply method
Can change whole invocation process -> EventDispatcher (more func args required)?

NaturalKey attribute required for reconstitution on AggregateRoot
Optional NaturalKey required for each entity
Default ValueObject should be best-effort deep value equality (overridable)

DefaultEventDispatcher - takes method name as argument
MementoEventDispatcher - takes method name as argument
MicrobusEventDispatcher - takes nested event dispatcher as argument

Event-based
Record events for persistence - requires factories
Do not record events for persistence - factories not required


=========== NEW ===========
Rework configuration - it should be explicit, not inferred
Create test suite for these dimensions:
Type (configuration)
Type (aggregate root, entity, value object) as coded

Something like this

Given a configuration for event-based non-persisting
When I create an aggregate for non event-based
Then the runtime throws an exception
