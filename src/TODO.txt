Default event dispatcher to take method name as parameter?
And to handle different method names for different base types

Functionality:
Can change name of aggregate apply method
Can change invocation process by specifying an EventDispatcher (not targeted) upon application instantiation

Default ValueObject should be best-effort deep value equality (overridable)

DefaultEventDispatcher - takes method name as argument
MementoEventDispatcher - takes method name as argument
MicrobusEventDispatcher - takes nested event dispatcher as argument

=========== NOTES ===========






Event-based
Record events for persistence - requires factories
Do not record events for persistence - factories not required


NaturalKey attribute required for reconstitution on AggregateRoot
Optional NaturalKey required for each entity
