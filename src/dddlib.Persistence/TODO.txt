Requirements:

Must be able to map a GUID to a serializable type eg. string
Must be able to map a GUID to a ValueObject
Must be able to map a GUID to a ValueObject with custom equality

Must be able to map a GUID to another version of the identifier




Example Table:
Version, SerializedValue, GUID
1, key, {GUID.1}
2, key-key2, {GUID.1}
1, otherKey,{GUID.2}

Load all keys from a specific version into a dictionary with GUID as the value.

Version upgrade will need to occur during the up-conversion process as the new key will likely require more information from the stream - or another stream.

What happens if just the serialization changes? Version change?

API:
GUID Map(object naturalKey)
